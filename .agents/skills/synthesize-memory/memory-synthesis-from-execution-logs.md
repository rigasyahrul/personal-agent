## Problem

Individual task execution transcripts contain valuable learnings, but:

- **Too specific**: "Make this button pink" isn't useful as general guidance
- **Unknown relevance**: Hard to predict which learnings apply to future tasks
- **Scattered knowledge**: Insights buried across hundreds of conversation logs
- **Abstraction challenge**: Difficult to know the right level of generality

Simply memorizing everything creates noise; ignoring everything loses valuable patterns.

## Solution

Implement a **two-tier memory system**:

1. **Task diaries**: Agent writes structured logs for each task (what it tried, what failed, why)
2. **Synthesis agents**: Periodically review multiple task logs to extract reusable patterns

The synthesis step identifies recurring themes across logs, surfacing insights that aren't obvious from any single execution. This approach is validated by academic research: Reflexion (NeurIPS 2023) achieved 91% pass@1 on HumanEval using episodic memory with self-reflection, and Stanford's Generative Agents paper demonstrates "reflection" mechanisms that synthesize higher-level insights from multiple memories.

    A[Task 1: Diary Entry] --> D[Synthesis Agent]
    B[Task 2: Diary Entry] --> D
    C[Task 3: Diary Entry] --> D
    D --> E[Extract Patterns]
    E --> F[Update System Prompts]
    E --> G[Create Slash Commands]
    E --> H[Generate Observations]
```

**Example diary entry format:**

```markdown
## Task: Add authentication to checkout flow

Attempted approaches:
1. JWT tokens in localStorage - failed due to XSS concerns
2. HTTP-only cookies - worked but needed CORS config
3. Session tokens with Redis - chosen solution

What worked:

- Redis session store with 24hr expiry
- CORS whitelist in production config

Mistakes made:

- Forgot to handle token refresh initially
- Missed error handling for expired sessions

Patterns discovered:

- Auth changes always need CORS update
- Need both client and server-side expiry checks
```

Structured formats (event, outcome, rationale) outperform raw conversation logs—validated by Reflexion's "memory blob" structure and ParamMem's finding that structured records reduce repetition and improve synthesis.

## How to use it

**Implementation approach:**

### Phase 1: Structured logging

Configure agents to write task diaries in consistent format:

- What was attempted and why
- What failed and the error messages
- What succeeded and why it worked
- Edge cases discovered
- Patterns that might generalize

### Phase 2: Periodic synthesis

Run synthesis agents over recent logs (weekly, after N tasks, etc.):

```pseudo
synthesis_agent.prompt = """
Review these 50 task diaries.
Identify patterns that appear in 3+ tasks.
For each pattern, suggest:

- A general rule to add to CLAUDE.md
- A potential slash command
- A test case to prevent regression
"""
```

### Phase 3: Knowledge integration

Feed synthesized insights back into:

- System prompts (CLAUDE.md)
- Reusable commands
- Automated checks/hooks
- Test suites

**Real usage at Anthropic (from transcript):**

> "There are some people at Anthropic where for every task they do, they tell Claude Code to write a diary entry in a specific format... they even have these agents that look over the past memory and synthesize it into observations."

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**

- **Pattern detection**: Finds recurring issues humans might miss
- **Right abstraction level**: Synthesis across multiple tasks reveals what's general
- **Automatic knowledge extraction**: Don't rely on humans remembering to document
- **Evolving memory**: System learns and improves over time
- **Evidence-based**: Patterns backed by multiple occurrences, not speculation

**Cons:**

- **Storage overhead**: Must persist all task logs
- **Synthesis complexity**: Requires sophisticated agents to extract good patterns
- **False patterns**: May identify coincidental correlations
- **Maintenance burden**: Synthesized rules need periodic review
- **Privacy concerns**: Logs may contain sensitive information
- **Token costs**: Synthesis over many logs is expensive
- **Cold start problem**: Insufficient data for reliable pattern extraction initially

**Open questions:**

- How many occurrences validate a pattern?
- How to prune outdated or wrong patterns?
- What's the right synthesis frequency?
- How to handle conflicting patterns across logs?
