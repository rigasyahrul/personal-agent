## Problem

AI agents lack continuous memory across sessions. Each conversation starts from zero, causing:

- **Lost familiarity**: The agent doesn't remember user preferences, goals, or working patterns
- **Repetitive explanations**: Users must re-explain context and preferences each session
- **Shallow relationships**: Agent cannot build deeper understanding of user's needs over time
- **Generic responses**: Without accumulated context, agents default to generic behaviors

While episodic memory systems store past *experiences*, they don't address the need for an evolving *self-identity*—who the agent is in relation to the user.

## Solution

Implement **dual-hook architecture** for self-identity accumulation:

1. **SessionStart Hook**: Inject accumulated identity/profile at session start
2. **SessionEnd Hook**: Extract new insights and refine the profile after each session
3. **Identity Document**: A persistent file (e.g., WHO_AM_I.md, SOUL.md) that evolves over time

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SessionStart
    participant IdentityFile as WHO_AM_I.md
    participant Agent
    participant User
    participant SessionEnd

    Note over SessionStart: New session begins
    SessionStart->>IdentityFile: Read profile
    IdentityFile-->>SessionStart: Return accumulated familiarity
    SessionStart->>Agent: Inject as context

    Agent->>User: "Hello! I remember..."

    Note over Agent,User: Conversation proceeds
    User->>Agent: Work together
    Agent->>User: Learn preferences

    Note over SessionEnd: Session terminates
    SessionEnd->>Agent: Extract insights from conversation
    Agent->>IdentityFile: Update with new insights
    IdentityFile-->>SessionEnd: Saved for next session
```

**Core mechanism:**

```python
# SessionStart: Inject accumulated identity
def session_start_hook():
    profile = read_file("WHO_AM_I.md")
    inject_context(profile)

# SessionEnd: Refine identity with new insights
def session_end_hook(conversation):
    new_insights = extract_insights(conversation)
    current_profile = read_file("WHO_AM_I.md")
    updated_profile = merge_insights(current_profile, new_insights)
    write_file("WHO_AM_I.md", updated_profile)
```

**Profile structure typically includes:**

- **Project Goals**: Evolving list of priorities and focus areas
- **Preferences**: Coding opinions, tool choices, architectural preferences
- **Communication Style**: Tone preferences, formatting conventions
- **Workflow Patterns**: Research practices, decision-making patterns
- **Boundaries**: What the agent should/shouldn't do

## Evidence

- **Evidence Grade:** `medium`
- **Most Valuable Findings:**
  - Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) achieved 91% pass rate on HumanEval vs 80% baseline through episodic memory with self-reflection
  - MemGPT (Packer et al., 2023) demonstrates hierarchical memory systems with virtual context management in production
  - Cursor AI's 10x-MCP persistent memory reported 26% improvement over OpenAI Memory with 90% token reduction (forum validation)
- **Unverified / Unclear:** Long-term identity accumulation studies (multi-month) and conflict resolution mechanisms for contradictory identity statements

## How to use it

**Implementation:**

1. Create identity document with initial structure
2. Configure SessionStart hook to read and inject it
3. Configure SessionEnd hook to refine it with new insights
4. Include instructions for when/how to update

**Example SessionStart hook (Claude Code):**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
from pathlib import Path

whoami_path = Path.cwd() / "WHO_AM_I.md"

if whoami_path.exists():
    with open(whoami_path) as f:
        profile = f.read()

    print(json.dumps({
        "hookSpecificOutput": {
            "additionalContext": profile
        }
    }))
```

**Example SessionEnd hook (Claude Code):**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import subprocess

PROMPT = """
Read WHO_AM_I.md and update it based on our conversation:
1. Extract NEW insights about the user
2. UPDATE each section (add new insights, keep existing)
3. Write updated content back
4. Update 'modified' date in frontmatter
"""

subprocess.run([
    "claude", "--continue", "-p", PROMPT,
    "--dangerously-skip-permissions"
])
```

**Prompting for self-refinement:**

The SessionEnd hook uses `--continue` to resume the conversation with a refinement prompt, allowing the agent to update its own identity document intelligently rather than through parsing.

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**

- **Continuous familiarity**: Agent "remembers" user across sessions
- **Deepening relationship**: Understanding accumulates over time
- **Reduced friction**: Less repetitive explanation of preferences
- **Personalized behavior**: Agent adapts to user's specific style
- **Transparent**: Identity is visible and editable by user

**Cons:**

- **Staleness risk**: Profile may become outdated if not updated
- **Overfitting**: Agent may become too specialized to one user
- **Context overhead**: Profile consumes tokens each session
- **Extraction noise**: SessionEnd may extract irrelevant "insights"
- **Requires hooks**: Needs lifecycle hook infrastructure

**Operational considerations:**

- Review and prune profile periodically
- Include metadata (created/modified dates) to track evolution
- Consider version control for profile changes
- Design prompts to avoid noise in insight extraction
- Balance specificity (more personalized) vs generality (more flexible)
