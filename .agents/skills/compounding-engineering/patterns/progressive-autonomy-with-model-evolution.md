## Problem

Agent scaffolding built for older models becomes unnecessary overhead as models improve:

- **Prompt bloat**: System prompts accumulate instructions that newer models don't need
- **Over-engineered flows**: Complex orchestration for tasks models can now handle directly
- **Wasted tokens**: Paying for instructions the model already knows
- **Slower execution**: Unnecessary steps add latency
- **Maintenance burden**: More code to maintain for diminishing benefit

Models improve faster than scaffolding is removed, creating technical debt.

## Solution

**Actively remove scaffolding** as models become more capable. Regularly audit system prompts, orchestration logic, and agent architecture to eliminate what newer models have internalized.

**Core principle**: Push complexity into the model itself rather than external scaffolding.

Operationalize this as a repeating simplification loop:
- Identify instructions that existed to compensate for older model weaknesses.
- Remove a slice of scaffolding and run controlled evals against production-like tasks.
- Keep deletions that preserve quality; revert deletions that increase failure risk.

The goal is not minimal prompts at all costs, but right-sized scaffolding for the current model generation.

graph LR
    A[Model v1] --> B[Needs Scaffolding]
    B --> C[Complex System Prompts]
    C --> D[Model v2 Released]
    D --> E[Remove Unnecessary Instructions]
    E --> F[Simpler, Faster Agent]
    F --> G[Model v3 Released]
    G --> H[Further Simplification]
```

**Example evolution:**

```pseudo
# Claude Opus 4.1 (older model)
system_prompt = """
When writing code:
1. First check if file exists
2. Read current contents
3. Plan your changes
4. Make minimal edits
5. Verify syntax
... [2000 more tokens of instructions]
"""

# Claude Sonnet 4.5 (newer model)
system_prompt = """
Write clean, tested code.
"""  # Model already knows the steps
```

## How to use it

**Regular audit process:**

1. **Track model releases**: Note when new models become available
2. **Test simplified prompts**: Remove instructions and see if quality degrades
3. **Measure token usage**: Quantify savings from prompt reduction
4. **A/B test scaffolding**: Compare outcomes with and without orchestration steps
5. **Delete what works**: If model performs equally without scaffolding, remove it

**What to look for:**

- Instructions that are "obvious" to humans (likely obvious to advanced models)
- Multi-step workflows models now handle in one turn
- Error-handling that models build in automatically
- Format specifications models infer from context
- Planning steps models do internally with extended thinking

**Scaffolding removal priority:**

| Category | Safe to Remove | Always Keep |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Obvious instructions | ✓ | |
| Step-by-step procedures | ✓ | |
| Format specifications | ✓ | |
| Domain knowledge | | ✓ |
| Safety constraints | | ✓ |

**Tools for prompt management:** Langfuse, LangSmith, Promptfoo (versioning, A/B testing, evaluation)

**Real example from Claude Code:**

> "I just deleted like 2,000 tokens or something from the system prompt yesterday. Just because Sonnet 4.5 doesn't need it anymore. But Opus 4.1 did need it." —Boris Cherny

**Boundary evolution:**

> "The boundary changes with every model in a surprising way, where the newer models, they're more intelligent. So the boundary of what you need plan mode for got pushed out a little bit." —Boris Cherny

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**

- **Reduced token costs**: Shorter prompts = cheaper inference
- **Faster execution**: Less processing overhead
- **Simpler maintenance**: Less code/prompts to manage
- **Future-proof**: Embraces model capabilities rather than fighting them
- **Better performance**: Models often work better with less hand-holding

**Cons:**

- **Requires testing**: Must validate that quality doesn't degrade
- **Version management**: May need different configs for different models
- **Loss of explicit control**: Less visibility into model's internal reasoning
- **Risk of regression**: Removing too much can hurt performance
- **Documentation debt**: May lose understanding of why scaffolding was added

**Strategic considerations:**

- **When to remove**: After new model is proven stable in production
- **How much to remove**: Start conservative, measure, iterate
- **What to keep**: Domain-specific knowledge models can't know
- **Migration path**: Support multiple model versions during transition

* Boris Cherny: "There's this frontier where you need to give the model a hard enough task to really push the limit... I think this is a general trend of stuff that used to be scaffolding with a more advanced model, it gets pushed into the model itself. The model kind of tends to subsume everything over time."
